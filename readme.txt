## Messenger for Abandoned Carts
Your store is losing money every day through abandoned carts. Facebook Messenger is the most effective way to win them back. Once your visitor adds the product to his cart and opts-in, your Facebook page sends him up to three follow-up messages if he didn't purchase.

## Discount offers
Incentivize your shoppers by revealing a discount code below your Add-to-cart button. With a single click, they get the offer. And your store now has permission to message them if they don't buy.

## Facebook Retargeting
Engage potential customers 1:1 through FB Messenger. Retargeting ads might leave an impression. But Messenger messages have super-high open rates and click-through rates so that your visitors can complete their purchase

## Messenger Marketing for both Abandoned Carts and Customers who purchased
AhaChat also lets you follow up with customers who purchased. You can do post-purchase upsells, send receipts, or ask customers for reviews. Delight your shoppers with personalized customer service follow-up to turn them into repeat customers.

## FAQ
Q: Who is the sender of the Facebook message?

A: Your Facebook Page that connected to bot automatically sends the message. During install, you'll be prompted to connect your AhaChat bot

Q: I already have an abandoned checkout app. Would I still use this?

A: Yes, you can use your current app to send emails to shoppers who left their email address. And this app will complement it by handling the visitors who did NOT leave an email address

Q: I don't have my checkbox prechecked by default. Can you help me get default-checked status?

A: No, Facebook is no longer reviewing and approving stores to get prechecked status
